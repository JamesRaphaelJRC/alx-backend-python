# Python Variable Anotation

Variable annotations in Python are a way to provide type hints for variables. They were introduced in Python 3.6 as part of PEP 526. Variable annotations allow you to associate a type with a variable, giving tools like linters, static analyzers, and type checkers information about the expected type of a variable.


## How to use/run test modules
Clone and move test modules to the 0x00-python_variable_annotations directory

    git clone https://github.com/JamesRaphaelJRC/alx-backend-python/0x00-python_variable_annotations.git
    cd 0x00-python_variable_annotations
    mv tests/* .

Run any of the test module in this format `./<test_module>.py`.
Example

    ./0-main.py



# Description for each module

### [0-add.py](https://github.com/JamesRaphaelJRC/alx-backend-python/blob/main/0x00-python_variable_annotations/0-add.py)
Writes a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float. 

### [1-concat.py](https://github.com/JamesRaphaelJRC/alx-backend-python/blob/main/0x00-python_variable_annotations/1-concat.py)
Writes a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string
